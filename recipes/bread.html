        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Irish soda bread is a type of quick bread that relies on baking soda, not yeast, to rise. The bread contains buttermilk, which contains lactic acid. </p>
        <p>The acid reacts with the baking soda to create air bubbles, resulting in a perfectly risen dough.</p>
        <p>Soda bread became incredibly common during the Irish Potato Famine, as you can make it with only four ingredients: flour, salt, an acid, and baking soda.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
